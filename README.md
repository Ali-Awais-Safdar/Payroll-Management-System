Our Payroll Management System is a straightforward and effective solution for employee management. With the use of C++ Class structure, we have developed a user-friendly program that allows users to easily add permanent or visiting employees and calculate their pay based on factors like experience and designation. A simple menu using switches has been incorporated for ease of use. The program also enables simple editing of employee data, which can be stored in a text file on the user's computer. It's an excellent tool for organizations seeking to simplify their payroll management process!
